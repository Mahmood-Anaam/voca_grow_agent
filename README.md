## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

- The agent connects to a **LiveKit room** and waits for a child participant to join.
- The child must send the following **participant attributes**:
  - `lang` â€“ Language (`"ar"` or `"en"`)
  - `character` â€“ Character name (`"Woody"`, `"Elsa"`, `"Spiderman"`, `"Snow"`)
  - `activitie` â€“ Selected learning activity (e.g., `"Colors"`, `"Shapes"`)
- Based on these attributes:
  - A **custom system prompt** is dynamically created (Arabic or English).
  - A **specific voice** is selected matching the character's gender:
  
    | Character   | Voice    |
    |-------------|----------|
    | Woody       | Puck     |
    | Spiderman   | Fenrir   |
    | Snow        | Aoede    |
    | Elsa        | Kore     |

- The agent then:
  - The agent fully adopts the child's selected character persona.
  - The agent pronounces a word related to the selected activity in the chosen language.
  - The agent asks the child to repeat the word.
  - The agent listens to the child's pronunciation attempt.
  - The agent provides positive feedback if the pronunciation is correct.
  - The agent gently repeats and encourages if the pronunciation needs improvement.
  - The agent avoids unrelated questions or topics.
  - The agent keeps interactions short, cheerful, and focused on pronunciation practice.



## ðŸ“¢ Important Notes

- If attributes are **not received within 30 seconds**, the agent uses default settings:  
  (`lang="ar"`, `character="Spiderman"`, `activitie="Shapes"`).
- Noise cancellation is **enabled if available** (fallbacks gracefully if the plugin is missing).
- The agent **only** focuses on pronunciation practice â€” no unrelated conversations are allowed.
- Real-time event handlers monitor when the child starts or stops speaking.
